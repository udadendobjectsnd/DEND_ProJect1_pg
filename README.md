## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Data  
<a id="song"></a>  
### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
<pre>
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
</pre>

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
<pre>
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
</pre>

<a id="log_data"></a>
### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
</pre>
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
</pre>
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.


If you would like to look at the json data within log_data files, you will need to create a Panda df to read the data. Remember to first import json and pandas libraries.
<pre>
df = pd.read_json(filepath, lines=True)
</pre>
For e.g., <pre>df = pd.read_json('data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-01-events.json', lines=True) </pre>would read the data file 2018-11-01-events.json

In case you need a refresher on JSON files, here is a helpful video from Udacity's Data Wrangling course talking about the JSON files format.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, we'll create a star schema optimized for queries
on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

<a id="fact"></a>

### Fact Table

1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays, i.e., records with
  page `NextSong`
    - *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id,
      location, user_agent*
    
A preview of the table



<a id="dim"></a>

### Dimension Tables

2. **users** - users in the app
    - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*

3. **songs** - songs in music database
    - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*

4. **artists** - artists in music database
    - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*

5. **time** - timestamps of records in **songplays** broken down into specific units
    - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*   
    
    
## Files

<pre>
.
├── create_tables.py--------Drops and creates tables. Running this file resets
|                           the tables before each time we run ETL scripts.
├── etl.ipynb---------------Reads and processes a single file from song_data and
|                           log_data and loads the data into our tables.
├── etl.py------------------Reads and processes files from song_data and
|                           log_data and loads them into our tables. We'll fill
|                           based on ETL notebook.
├── sql_queries.py----------Contains all our SQL queries, and is imported into
|                           the last three files above.
└── test.ipynb--------------Displays the first few rows of each table to let us
                            check our database.
